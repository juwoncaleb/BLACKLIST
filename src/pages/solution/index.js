                                One of the major reasons for rising non-performing loans (NPL) is due to inadequate credit checks by lenders as well as people gaming the loan system as the unbanked and underbanked population are not covered by traditional credit databases . Hence, the need for alternative sources of credit data.
                                On the other hand, debtors are unable to pay back sometimes for understandable reasons. Or become elusive due to threatening collection processes by some lenders and collection agencies, et cetera. </p>
